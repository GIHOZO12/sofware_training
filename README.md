name of project: coding javascriipt challenge(arrayMap.js)
features
function name:arraymapping()

a function that takes two arguments : first argguments is a subarray and a second is a target sum

a function that make a for loop to pass through each element in a subarray while making a sum of all those elements

there is a while loop executes as long as the currentsum exceeds the target and the starting index sum is less than or equal to the current index i :This ensures the loop only runs if the current sum is greater than the target sum and there are elements to remove from the start of the subarray -currentsum -= arra[sum]: Inside the while loop, the element at the sum index is subtracted from currentsum. This step effectively reduces the subarray's size by removing elements from the beginning.

                 -sum++: The start index sum is incremented, moving the start of the subarray one position to the right.
if (currentsum === target): This if statement checks if the currentsum is exactly equal to the target value. and then it return true

using javacript and solve this algorithm question function name:stringtransform()
it wwill check if a string provided is divisible by 3 if condition it's true it will reverse all string by the loop i used in

it will check if a string provided is divisible by 5 if condition is true it will replace each code withits ASCII code.

it will also check if a string provided in a an argument is divisible by both 5 and 3 and it may perform booth reverse and aftter replace each with its ASCII code.
